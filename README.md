## The Project

“Truth-seekers or Peace-brokers: The League of Nations and its Commissions of Inquiry”
The research project examines the processes of factual inquiry and knowledge production within a highly politicised international environment embodied in the work of League Inquiry Commissions, in order to grasp how the quest for objective truth intersected with political deal-making. Who were the League’s experts, and what bearing did their findings have on the conduct of international politics?
